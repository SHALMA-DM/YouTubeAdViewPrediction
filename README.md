üìù Project Overview
The goal of the project is to predict YouTube video adviews using various features from the dataset. Multiple regression models are used and compared to identify the one with the best performance. Models used include:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Support Vector Regressor
Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
üîÑ Data Preprocessing
The dataset contains features such as:

vidid: Video ID (ignored for modeling).
adview: Target variable representing adviews.
views: Total video views.
likes: Number of likes.
dislikes: Number of dislikes.
comment: Number of comments.
published: Video publication date.
duration: Duration of the video.
category: Video category.
Steps Taken:
Converted non-numeric fields like video duration to numeric.
Handled missing values, outliers, and cleaned data.
Visualized key features with histograms and boxplots.
üìä Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Results on Validation Set:
Model	MAE	RMSE
Linear Regression	3622.09	32114.31
Decision Tree	2141.25	28428.92
Random Forest	[TBD]	[TBD]
Support Vector	[TBD]	[TBD]
Artificial Neural Network	[TBD]	[TBD]
