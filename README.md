This project predicts YouTube adviews based on features like views, likes, dislikes, and comments using various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVR, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The repository contains all the essential files, including the main script (YouTube Prediction.py), pre-trained models, visualizations, and test predictions. To run the project, simply clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies using **"pip install -r requirements.txt"**, and execute the script by running **"python YouTube Prediction.py"**. This project provides insights into adview prediction and the performance of different models on YouTube data.
